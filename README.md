# Machine Learning Approach To Generating And Predicting Peptide Based Inhibitors

- **Overview**: This repository contains notebooks and datasets used for the MSc thesis on predicting the binding affinity and stability of protein-peptide complexes.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebook**: 
  - `Mutation Model.ipynb`: This notebook contains all functions related to predicting a mutation given a peptide residue sequence, including feature engineering, model training, and classifying which peptide to mutate. 
- **Datasets**: 
  - `dataset_V3.csv`: This dataset contains all processed structured peptide binding data.
  - `BLOSUM62.txt`: This file contains the BLOSUM62 matrix called in the `Prediction Model.ipynb`.

## Installation Instructions

- **Dependencies**: Python 3.x, required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Setup**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that all files should be in the same folder before running the `Mutation Model.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage

- **How to Use**: Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell in order.
